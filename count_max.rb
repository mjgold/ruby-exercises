# Method name: count_max
# Inputs:      A list of numbers
# Returns:     The number of times the largest number in the list
#              appears in the list
# Prints:      Nothing
#
# For example,
#   count_max([10, 1,2,10,10]) == 3
# because "10" is the largest number in the list and it occurs 3 times

# This is how we require the max.rb and count_in_list.rb files in the current folder.
# We can now use the "max" and "count_in_list" methods we defined there â€” justs
# as if we had defined them here!
